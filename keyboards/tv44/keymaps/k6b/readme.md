# k6b's keymap for tv44

Just guessing on initial personal preference, much of this will likely change.

* Changed KC_ESC on to be KC_RSFT to match massdrop keyset configuration
* Changed arrow keys to use HJKL like a sane person
* Removed "10-key" from L2 and added utility keys (Will need to double check on BL keys)
* Moved layout selection to the bottom to have a normal number row on L2
* Added PGUP/PGDN, HOME/END to L2
* Removed all the game things from L3, not sure how useful this will be to me but I don't need that
* L3 has 10-key on it now, made more sense for this to be on a toggle layer
* Using Keypad number keycodes for "10-key"
